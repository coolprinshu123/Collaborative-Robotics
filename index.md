# Google Summer of code 2k18 Report

# Robocomp

It is time to finally summarize the work done by me as GSoC summer intern. First of all I would like to thank my mentors Iván Barbecho Delgado and Marco A Gutiérrez who has always provided a helping hand whenever I was stuck. It has been an awesome experience as the GSoC intern.

# Learnblock (Learnbot programming language) extension for collaborative robotics

Learnblock is a project to teach children how to program a robot.
LearnBlock is the programing tool designed for easy usage of the Learnbot robot. It is
meant to be used by students and to help them learn new concepts by the usage of
robotics programming. I will be extending the Learnblock programming tool to manage
collaborative robotics between learnbots. I will be developing a system that enables
Learnbot to communicate between and offer this option through the learnblock tool to
the end user.

# Future works that can be done

1. The present code base uses ``` iot.eclipse.org ``` as broker. It can be extended to use ``` localhost ``` as the broker.

2. The collaborative Robotics uses friendly type connection and it can be extended for master slave type connection.
