# Learnblock (Learnbot programming language) extension for collaborative robotics

Learnblock is a project to teach children how to program a robot.
LearnBlock is the programing tool designed for easy usage of the Learnbot robot. It is
meant to be used by students and to help them learn new concepts by the usage of
robotics programming. I will be extending the Learnblock programming tool to manage
collaborative robotics between learnbots. I will be developing a system that enables
Learnbot to communicate between and offer this option through the learnblock tool to
the end user.
